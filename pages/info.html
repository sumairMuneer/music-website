			Garth Brooks is the 7-time CMA Entertainer of the Year, a first for any artist. He is also the first and
			only artist in history to receive nine Diamond Awards for the now nine albums certified by the RIAA at over
			10 million album sales each. He remains the #1-selling solo artist in U.S. history, certified by the RIAA
			with 157 million album sales. In March 2020, Garth received the esteemed Library of Congress Gershwin Prize
			for Popular Song. The event aired on PBS. &nbsp;He has received every accolade the recording industry can
			bestow on an artist.</p>
			<p data-uw-styling-context="true">In April, CBS aired <em data-uw-styling-context="true">Garth &amp; Trisha
			   Live!</em> during prime time. The concert was live from their home recording studio, Studio G. They took
			   song requests from fans live through Facebook.</p>
			<p data-uw-styling-context="true">In November of 2019, A&amp;E aired "Garth Brooks: The Road I'm On," over
			   two consecutive nights. Part of their esteemed 'Biography' franchise, the documentary offered an intimate
			   look at Garth's life as a musician and father over his entire career.</p>
			<p data-uw-styling-context="true">In January, <em data-uw-styling-context="true">Billboard</em> announced
			   that Garth Brooks was the first artist to make it on the <em
				   data-uw-styling-context="true">Billboard</em> Hot Country Songs chart in the '80s, '90s, '00s, '10s
			   and now '20s. Garth debuted "Much Too Young (To Feel This Damn Old)" in 1989. Now, with "Dive Bar," a
			   duet he sang with Blake Shelton, he makes his appearance on the list in 2020. The single inspired a DIVE
			   BAR tour to dive bars in country music capitals around the country, which will continue its run of stops
			   through 2022. </p>
			<p data-uw-styling-context="true">
			   Last year, Garth went vinyl with his meticulously-curated vinyl package, LEGACY. This career-defining
			   collection includes <em data-uw-styling-context="true">No Fences, The Chase, In Pieces, Fresh Horses</em>
			   and <em data-uw-styling-context="true">Triple Live</em>, plus CDs with bonus tracks for a total of 7
			   vinyl albums and 7 CDs in each edition.
			</p>
			<p data-uw-styling-context="true">
			   In March 2019, Garth launched The Stadium Tour, which has broken stadium attendance records at every stop
			   on the tour so far. <em data-uw-styling-context="true">Pollstar</em> announced The Garth Brooks Stadium
			   Tour was the best-selling country music tour of 2019. In 2017, Garth finished the three-and-a-half-year
			   long Garth Brooks World Tour with Trisha Yearwood. The tour sold over 6.3 million tickets, making it the
			   biggest North American tour in history and the biggest American tour in the world.</p>
			<p data-uw-styling-context="true">Garth also has Inside Studio G, a weekly Facebook Live series. It airs
			   every Monday on Garth's Facebook page at 7:00 PM EST. </p>
